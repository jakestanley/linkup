# Nice to haves
- Radio button game selection
- RCON support through UI
- Change map/scenario etc without restarting server
- Stop server through UI instead of kill (threading)
- pop up on server install to inform user they may need to wait and not get impatient
- save game configs
- steam workshop files
- support more games
- client launch button
- wrap console output within app instead of spawning separate window
- progress bar (requires wrapping steamcmd output)
